# Algorithm & DataStucture

## Introduction

This repository contains implemtation of some algorithm and data structure.

The code is written in C++ class style.

## Implemented

* heap, heap_template, support customize compare function and data.
* leftist Tree, basic heap opertion, quick merge, use it solve OJ problem(HDU-1512)
* Union set, path compression and weighted tree
* Quick-sort, randomized pivot, two ways of partition
* quick_power, data type:integer

## TODO
* skip list
* Matrix data structure, support +, -, *, power
* graph
	* SPFA
	* Dijkstra
	* Kruskal
	* Floyd
	* Tarjan
* network flow
* DP
	* LCSï¼Œ small space, reconstruct seq
